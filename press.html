creating the Apt 24® Flow was to make RVing easier. That mission involves more than just the hardware, but what makes the hardware work so seamlessly. With this goal in mind, we've harnessed the power of cutting-edge technology, robotic software, and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a set of groundbreaking, world-first intelligent features that automate the hardest parts of RVing.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Our first stride was to build an exceptionally smart and capable RV, but what follows is equally crucial—creating an iPhone-like, intuitive experience for our customers. The solution to this is the Apt 24® App, designed to ensure that you don't need to be a tech guru to savor the magic of the Apt 24® Flow. If you can comfortably use an iPhone, you'll find operating the Apt 24® Flow just as effortless.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Apt 24® App serves as your command center and the gateway to all the intelligence integrated into the Apt 24® Flow.

The Apt 24® App was born out of a desire to redefine your interaction with your vehicle. It's not just about convenience; it's about creating an entirely new, user-friendly way to operate your RV. You’ll be RVing like never before.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Everything you need is in the palm of your hand. From interior features like temperature control, dimmable lighting, and monitoring the level of your battery state of charge (SoC) and water tanks to high-tech controls like InstaCamp, Remote Control, Magic Hitch, and even checking your solar charge. The app makes RVing very simple and intuitive.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Another plus? No internet, no problem. All communication necessary for Apt 24® Flow's functions is kept within a local network, bypassing the need for cloud or internet service providers.

Over everything else, we understand simplicity is key. That's why we offer two access points to the Apt 24® App: your smartphone and the detachable iPad Mini that comes with the Apt 24® Flow. The phone provides on-the-go control, for access whenever you need it. The iPad offers a more spacious interface to display information. The choice is yours, ensuring you always have control of the Apt 24® Flow at your fingertips.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"My personal favorite part of the Apt 24® Flow and the Apt 24® App is that, unlike typical vehicles that become outdated and lose value the second you drive off the lot, the Apt 24® Flow isn't static; it's a dynamic platform that evolves as you use it. Through Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, we’ll continually add new features and refine existing ones. Your Apt 24® Flow will get smarter and smarter.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Apt 24® App incorporates state-of-the-art security measures, validated and tested in the automotive industry.
